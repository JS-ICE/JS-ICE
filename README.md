# J-ICE 

#### This is the repository of J-ICE: A Jmol Interface for Crystallographic and Electronic Properties.

J-ICE is an extension of the powerful, platform independent molecular visualizer Jmol, towards crystallographic and electronic properties. 

#### We are working to convert this code written in Java in practical JavaScript. 

#### We are also slowly moving from our old web-site http://j-ice.sourceforge.net to our new home @ GitHub.
